# Quran-Api-Node.Js

You will build a simple command line tool which makes a request to an API, display content, andstores the data in a text file! 

We will be using the following modules:
fs - for reading and writing to a file
process - for gathering arguments from the command line
axios - for making API requests (this is an external module)

This application should accept a command line argument using process.argv

We are fetching data from rapidapi and displaying the result in console as well in text file.

npm init to install node

npm i fs axios dotenv process

node app.js {surahNumber from 1 to 114}
